            "Personality Development and Communication Skill. Develop your own identity!!!   **Personality development**  is the relatively enduring pattern of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that distinguish individuals from one another. The dominant view in the field of personality psychology today holds that personality emerges early and continues to change in meaningful ways throughout the lifespan.  Adult personality traits are believed to have a basis in infant [temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament \"Temperament\"), meaning that individual differences in disposition and behavior appear early in life, possibly even before language or conscious self-representation develop. [The Five Factor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits \"Big Five personality traits\") of personality has been found to map onto dimensions of childhood temperament, suggesting that individual differences in levels of the \"big five\" personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) are present from young ages.  Three main types of gene-environment interactions are  **active**  (the process by which individuals with certain genotypes select and create environments that facilitate the expression of those genotypes),  **passive** (the process by which genetic parents provide both the genes and the early environmental influences that contribute to the development of a characteristic in their children), and  **reactive**  (the process by which non-family individuals respond to the behavior produced by a genotype in characteristic ways).  This principle summarizes how gene-environment interactions (also called person-situation transactions) maintain and reinforce the continuity of personality throughout the lifespan.\n",

Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have  **NO  prior knowledge** in hacking and by the end of it you'll be able to   **hack systems like black-hat hackers**  and  **secure them like security experts!**  This course is highly  **practical**  but it won't neglect the theory, so we'll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you'll  **learn everything by example** , by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to **practically**  exploit theses weaknesses and hack into it, not only that but you'll also learn how to secure this system from the discussed attacks. This course will take you  **from a beginner to a more advanced level  **by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.  Certificate of Completion\n",

            "Personality Development and Communication Skill. Develop your own identity!!!   **Personality development**  is the relatively enduring pattern of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that distinguish individuals from one another. The dominant view in the field of personality psychology today holds that personality emerges early and continues to change in meaningful ways throughout the lifespan.  Adult personality traits are believed to have a basis in infant [temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament \"Temperament\"), meaning that individual differences in disposition and behavior appear early in life, possibly even before language or conscious self-representation develop. [The Five Factor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits \"Big Five personality traits\") of personality has been found to map onto dimensions of childhood temperament, suggesting that individual differences in levels of the \"big five\" personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) are present from young ages.  Three main types of gene-environment interactions are  **active**  (the process by which individuals with certain genotypes select and create environments that facilitate the expression of those genotypes),  **passive** (the process by which genetic parents provide both the genes and the early environmental influences that contribute to the development of a characteristic in their children), and  **reactive**  (the process by which non-family individuals respond to the behavior produced by a genotype in characteristic ways).  This principle summarizes how gene-environment interactions (also called person-situation transactions) maintain and reinforce the continuity of personality throughout the lifespan.\n",

Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have  **NO  prior knowledge** in hacking and by the end of it you'll be able to   **hack systems like black-hat hackers**  and  **secure them like security experts!**  This course is highly  **practical**  but it won't neglect the theory, so we'll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you'll  **learn everything by example** , by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to **practically**  exploit theses weaknesses and hack into it, not only that but you'll also learn how to secure this system from the discussed attacks. This course will take you  **from a beginner to a more advanced level  **by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.  Certificate of Completion\n",
